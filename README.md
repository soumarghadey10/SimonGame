# SimonGame
In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to the next level.When a coloured button flashes, you click on the button. When you get futher on in the game you will have several colours to rememeber in order. The game gets harder the longer you play!
